# Tasks List

Hello! 
I would like to present a simple task list application. This application is easy and intuitive. Just write in the field what you have to do and then press the “add task” button or “enter” on the keyboard. Below you will see the typed tasks. You can mark them as completed or uncompleted (green button) or delete them (red button). 

Below is the presentation, link to the application and the technologies used.
